# Chat Deletion Functionality

This document provides detailed information about the chat deletion feature in the ChatGPT UI application, including workflow, implementation details, and user experience considerations.

## Overview

The ChatGPT UI application allows users to delete chats through multiple methods:
1. Right-click context menu on a chat in the sidebar
2. Delete button within the chat interface (planned enhancement)
3. Keyboard shortcut support (planned enhancement)

## Implementation Details

### User Interface Components

The chat deletion functionality is implemented across several components:

1. **Sidebar.vue**:
   - Contains the chat list where users can right-click on a chat
   - Displays the context menu with a "Delete Chat" option
   - Emits a `delete-chat` event when the option is selected

2. **App.vue**:
   - Receives the `delete-chat` event from the Sidebar
   - Calls the `handleDeleteChat` method with the chat ID
   - Updates the selected chat if the deleted chat was active

3. **ChatWindow.vue**:
   - Contains a "Clear" button that clears all messages in a chat without deleting the chat itself
   - Future enhancement: Add a proper "Delete" button

### Backend API

The chat deletion process uses two main API endpoints:

1. **Delete a chat**: `/api/chats/:id`
   - Method: `DELETE`
   - Deletes both the chat and all its messages
   - Returns a success confirmation with the deleted chat ID

2. **Clear chat messages**: `/api/chats/:id/messages`
   - Method: `DELETE`
   - Removes all messages from a chat but keeps the chat itself
   - Returns a success confirmation with the chat ID

### Implementation Flow

1. User triggers deletion (currently through the context menu)
2. A confirmation dialog is shown (using standard browser `confirm`)
3. If confirmed, the deletion request is sent to the API
4. Upon successful deletion:
   - The chat is removed from the sidebar
   - If it was the active chat, another chat is selected or a new one is created
   - A success message is shown to the user (planned enhancement)

## Current Limitations

The current implementation has several limitations:

1. Basic confirmation dialog using browser's native `confirm()` method
2. No visual feedback after successful deletion
3. Limited access points (only through context menu)
4. No keyboard shortcut support
5. No undo functionality

## Planned Enhancements

The following enhancements are planned for the chat deletion feature:

1. **Improved Confirmation Dialog**:
   - Custom styled dialog instead of browser default
   - Clearer messaging about the permanent nature of deletion

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Toast notification confirming successful deletion
   - Temporary highlight effect on the sidebar

3. **Additional Access Points**:
   - Delete button in the ChatWindow header
   - Option in a settings menu (for future implementation)

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Delete key when a chat is selected
   - Modifier key combinations (e.g., Ctrl+D)

5. **Undo Functionality**:
   - Temporary option to restore a recently deleted chat
   - Status message with undo button

## User Experience Considerations

When implementing chat deletion, the following UX principles should be considered:

1. **Clear Confirmation**: Users should understand what they're about to delete
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Visual confirmation that the action completed successfully
3. **Error Handling**: Clear messaging if deletion fails
4. **Consistent Placement**: Delete options should be consistently placed across the interface
5. **Safeguards**: Confirmation required for destructive actions

## Testing Recommendations

When testing the chat deletion functionality, consider the following scenarios:

1. Deleting a chat that is not currently selected
2. Deleting the currently selected chat
3. Deleting the last remaining chat
4. Attempting to delete multiple chats in succession
5. Testing the feature during API connection issues
