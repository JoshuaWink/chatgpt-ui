## Progress Entries

### June 28, 2023 - Chat Deletion Enhancement

**Completed:**
- Reviewed existing chat deletion implementation across components
- Identified areas for improvement in the chat deletion workflow
- Added a dedicated Delete button to the ChatWindow header
- Updated App.vue to handle delete events from ChatWindow
- Created comprehensive documentation for chat deletion in docs/chat-deletion.md
- Updated README.md and docs/README.md to reference the new documentation

**Challenges:**
